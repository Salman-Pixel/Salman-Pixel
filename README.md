# 🚀 Yo, I'm Salman & I Build Stuff That Thinks

**AI Engineer @ Pakistan's Special Technology Zones Authority** where I'm teaching machines to automate government bureaucracy (yes, really).

I make intelligent systems that don't just work—they *vibe*. From multi-agent AI orchestrations to full-stack apps that scale, I'm here building the future one API call at a time.

            "☕ Coffee",
            "🤖 Train AI agents",
            "💻 Ship production code",
            "🔥 Break something",
            "🛠️ Fix it (mostly)",
            "🎮 Repeat"
        ]
```

## 🔥 My Most Unhinged Projects

### 🤖 [Travel Planner Agent](https://github.com/Salman-Pixel/travel-planner)
**What it does:** Multiple AI agents argue with each other to plan your perfect trip  
**Tech:** LangGraph + FastAPI + SQLite  
**Vibe:** Your personal travel agency, but it's all robots

### 🏔️ [Hunza Itinerary RAG](https://github.com/Salman-Pixel/hunza_rag/)
**What it does:** AI that reads tourist PDFs and actually cites its sources (novel concept, I know)  
**Tech:** Python + RAG + Embeddings  
**Vibe:** ChatGPT but it actually read the manual

### 🌐 [Gulmit.info](https://gulmit.info)
**What it does:** Full tourism platform with AI content pipelines because static content is for the weak  
**Tech:** Next.js + Firebase + Cloudflare  
**Vibe:** When you want your tourism site to load faster than your attention span

### 📱 One-Stop Shop App
**What it does:** On-demand home services marketplace with real-time tracking  
**Tech:** React Native + Node.js + MongoDB  
**Vibe:** Uber but for literally everything else

### 🚗 [Uber 2.0](https://github.com/Salman-Pixel/Uber-Drive-Order-Food/tree/master)
**What it does:** Ride-booking clone because I wanted to see if I could  
**Tech:** React Native + Google Maps  
**Vibe:** "Mom, can we get Uber?" "We have Uber at home"
